# Vue Spreadsheet Application

### Hello there! 👋 
Welcome to our Vue Spreadsheet Application project. 
This is a sleek, user-friendly web app built using Vue.js, providing you with a dynamic spreadsheet experience. It's perfect for anyone who needs to manage and organize data in a tabular format, without the hassle of complex software.

### 🚀 Features
- Multiple Tabs: Seamlessly switch between various tabs for different data sets.
- Editable Cells: Click on any cell to edit its content, just like you would in Excel or Google Sheets.
- Infinite Scrolling: Keep scrolling down, and new rows will appear like magic! No more manual adding of rows.
- Focused Interaction: Click on a cell, and you'll see the corresponding row and column headers get highlighted. This makes tracking your position in large data sets a breeze.

### 📋 How It Works
- Tabs Management: You can create new tabs or switch between existing ones using the tabs bar at the top. Each tab holds a unique set of data.
- Editing Cells: Simply click on a cell to edit its content. Your changes are saved as soon as you move to another cell or press enter.
- Scrolling for More: When you reach the bottom of the spreadsheet, more rows will load automatically. Say goodbye to adding rows manually!

### 🎨 Styling
